Space Wars
Space Wars is a simple arcade-style space game developed using Python Mode in Processing. The player pilots a spaceship dodging falling asteroids and collecting coins and “Infinity Stones” to activate a temporary invincibility shield.

Purpose
This project demonstrates building a 2D game in Processing with Python, covering key concepts like sprite animation, collision detection, user input, and sound integration. It’s ideal for developers interested in creative coding or game development in Processing.py.

Features
Horizontally movable spaceship controlled via left/right arrow keys

Falling asteroids as obstacles that speed up as score increases

Collectible coins (+5 points) and four types of Infinity Stones (+10 points each)

Power-up shield activates after collecting all four stones, granting temporary invincibility

Scoring system with on-screen display

Background music using the Minim library

Start menu and game over screen with restart functionality

Installation
Download and install Processing.

Add Python Mode in Processing via the Mode selector > Add Mode.

Clone or download this repository.

Open Sexarush.pyde in Processing with Python Mode active.

Run the sketch using the Play button.

Ensure the data and images folders remain intact for assets and music.

How to Play
Use Left/Right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally.

Avoid asteroids; collision without shield ends the game.

Collect coins and Infinity Stones to increase your score.

Collect all four unique stones to activate the invincibility shield (Sexa Shield).

Shield lasts until you gain 15 more points, then deactivates.

Click to restart after game over.

Project Structure
Sexarush.pyde: Main Processing.py game code containing classes for background, spaceship, obstacles, coins, power-ups, and scoring.

data/: Contains fonts and background music (piano.mp3).

images/: Game sprites including spaceship, asteroids, coins, stones, shield ring, and backgrounds.

sketch.properties: Processing configuration file.
